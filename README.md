PSX-IGR is a combo-triggered reset mod for the PlayStation 1, enhancing reset control with controller-safe logic and LED feedback.  
Originally based on the [**PlayStation 1 Reset Mod**](https://github.com/pyroesp/PlayStation-1-Reset-Mod) (2019), this version introduces improved input handling as timed combo-triggered reset, and responsive LED support, while being fully optimized for the PIC16F18325/26.

## Features

- âœ… Combo hold logic to prevent unintentional resets
- âœ… Combo feedback LED driven by asynchronous timer interrupt
- âœ… Reset feedback LED blink handled via the same non-blocking mechanism
- âœ… Support for PSU-mounted common-anode dual LED (RA5 control only)
- âœ… Optional support for 2-pin bicolor LED between RA4 and RA5 (dual-color feedback)
- âœ… Safe reset duration with post-reset lockout period
- âœ… Controller and GunCon combo support (based on ID)
- âœ… Behavior and timings fully configurable via `#define` macros

---

## How It Works

- Monitors SPI communication from the controller port.
- When a valid controller ID is detected, combo inputs are checked:
  - **Select + Start + L2 + R2** (standard controller)
  - **A + Trigger + B** (GunCon)
  - **Select + X + L2 + R2** (XStation combo)
- A combo must be held for `COMBO_HOLD` ms to trigger a reset.
- Reset is held for `SHORT_DELAY` or `LONG_DELAY` depending on combo.
- During reset, the LED provides visual feedback with `RESET_BLINK_COUNT` blinks.
- After reset, a lockout period (`REBOOT_DELAY`) ensures safe recovery before new inputs are accepted.

---

## Configurable Timing Parameters

You can modify these constants in `main.c` to adjust behavior:

```c
#define COMBO_HOLD           1250  // ms - Time combo must be held to trigger reset
#define RESET_BLINK_COUNT       3  // Number of blink cycles after reset
#define RESET_BLINK_TOTAL_MS  500  // ms - Total blink duration
#define RESET_BLINK_DELAY_MS  200  // ms - Delay after blink before returning to idle
```

## Building & Flashing

### Source Code (Optional Compilation)
To build from source:
- Use [MPLAB X IDE](https://www.microchip.com/en-us/tools-resources/develop/mplab-x-ide) and [XC8 Compiler](https://www.microchip.com/en-us/tools-resources/develop/mplab-xc-compilers)
- Target microcontroller: **PIC16F18325** or **PIC16F18326**
- Set `__CONFIG` fuses appropriately for:
  - Internal 32 MHz oscillator
  - MCLR enabled
- Flash using ICSP with PICKit 3 or newer

### âš¡ Precompiled `.hex`
For convenience, a precompiled **`.hex` file** is included in the [Releases](../../releases) section.  
This allows quick flashing using:

- **MPLAB IPE 6.20 or newer**
- **PICKit 3** or compatible programmer

No source compilation is required if using the `.hex`.

## LED Wiring Options

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Always use a **100â€¯Î© resistor** in series with the **RA5 (pin 2)** output.  
> This applies to all LED configurations: standalone red, 3-pin common-anode, or 2-pin bicolor.

### LED Configurations Overview

#### ðŸ”´ RA5 (pin 2) - Red Output (Mandatory)
- Drives red LED for **combo feedback** and **reset blink**.
- Must always be used, either alone or with RA4.
- Compatible with:
  - **3-pin common-anode LED**: Red cathode to RA5 via 100â€¯Î© resistor.
  - **Single-color LED**: Anode to VCC, cathode to RA5 via 100â€¯Î© resistor.

> [!TIP]
> For 3-pin common-anode LEDs:  
> Replace the **original PSU resistor** (typically 120-130â€¯Î©) in series with the **green cathode** with a **470â€¯Î© resistor**.  
> This reduces the green brightness to better match the red LED (driven by RA5), providing more balanced LED feedback.

#### ðŸŸ¢ RA4 (pin 3) - Green Output (Optional)
- Used **only** when connecting a **2-pin bicolor LED (antiparallel)** between **RA4** and **RA5**.
- Provides idle green indication; RA4 does not blink during reset.
- Do **not** connect RA4 to the green terminal (cathode) of a 3-pin common-anode LED:  
  - RA4 is not meant to drive LEDs directly to GND.  
  - It only functions as part of a polarity-switching pair (RA4â€“RA5) for 2-pin bicolor LEDs.  
  - Using RA4 for a discrete green LED will result in incorrect or no indication.

> [!WARNING]
> RA4 is **not suitable** for standalone LED use.  
> It only works correctly in conjunction with RA5 using a 2-pin bicolor LED.

### Summary

> [!NOTE]
> - ðŸ”´ **RA5** handles all meaningful LED signaling (combo, reset blink).  
> - ðŸŸ¢ **RA4** is used **only** for idle indication when using a 2-pin bicolor LED.  
> - When using a **3-pin LED**, never connect RA4 to the green terminal.  
> - For **single red LEDs**, connect anode to VCC and cathode to RA5 via 100â€¯Î© resistor.
