# PSX In-Game Reset

PSX-IGR is a combo-triggered reset mod for the PlayStation 1, enhancing reset control with controller-safe logic and LED feedback.  
Originally based on the [**PlayStation 1 Reset Mod**](https://github.com/pyroesp/PlayStation-1-Reset-Mod) (2019), this version introduces improved input handling as timed combo-triggered reset, and responsive LED support, while being fully optimized for the PIC16F18325/26.

## Features

- âœ… Combo hold logic to prevent unintentional resets
- âœ… Combo feedback LED driven by asynchronous timer interrupt
- âœ… Reset feedback LED blink handled via the same non-blocking mechanism
- âœ… Support for PSU-mounted common-anode dual LED (RA5 control only)
- âœ… Optional support for 2-pin bicolor LED between RA4 and RA5 (dual-color feedback)
- âœ… Safe reset duration with post-reset lockout period
- âœ… Controller and GunCon combo support (based on ID)
- âœ… Behavior and timings fully configurable via `#define` macros

---

## How It Works

- Monitors SPI communication from the controller port.
- When a valid controller ID is detected, combo inputs are checked:
  - **Select + Start + L2 + R2** (standard controller)
  - **A + Trigger + B** (GunCon)
  - **Select + X + L2 + R2** (XStation combo)
- A combo must be held for `COMBO_HOLD` ms to trigger a reset.
- Reset is held for `SHORT_DELAY` or `LONG_DELAY` depending on combo.
- During reset, the LED provides visual feedback with `RESET_BLINK_COUNT` blinks.
- After reset, a lockout period (`REBOOT_DELAY`) ensures safe recovery before new inputs are accepted.

---

## Configurable Timing Parameters

You can modify these constants in `main.c` to adjust behavior:

```c
#define COMBO_HOLD           1250  // ms - Time combo must be held to trigger reset
#define RESET_BLINK_COUNT       3  // Number of blink cycles after reset
#define RESET_BLINK_TOTAL_MS  500  // ms - Total blink duration
#define RESET_BLINK_DELAY_MS  200  // ms - Delay after blink before returning to idle
```

## Building & Flashing

### Source Code (Optional Compilation)
To build from source:
- Use [MPLAB X IDE](https://www.microchip.com/en-us/tools-resources/develop/mplab-x-ide) and [XC8 Compiler](https://www.microchip.com/en-us/tools-resources/develop/mplab-xc-compilers)
- Target microcontroller: **PIC16F18325** or **PIC16F18326**
- Set `__CONFIG` fuses appropriately for:
  - Internal 32 MHz oscillator
  - MCLR enabled
- Flash using ICSP with PICKit 3 or newer

### âš¡ Precompiled `.hex`
For convenience, a precompiled **`.hex` file** is included in the [Releases](../../releases) section.  
This allows quick flashing using:

- **MPLAB IPE 6.20 or newer**
- **PICKit 3** or compatible programmer

No source compilation is required if using the `.hex`.

## LED Wiring Options

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Always use one 100â€“120â€¯Î© resistor in series with the RA5 output pin.**  
> This applies to all LED configurations, whether using a single LED or a dual-color setup.

### ðŸ”´ RA5 alone (cathode sinking)
Use RA5 for a single LED (any color), or for the red side of a dual-color setup:
- Single LED: `K` to RA5, `A` to PSU +3.5V (standalone)
- Red terminal of a 3-pin common-anode LED
- Red side of a 2-pin bicolor LED (when used with RA4)

> [!TIP]
> For 3-pin common-anode LEDs, if the green cathode is tied directly to PSU, a 1â€“2â€¯kÎ© resistor can be added in series with the green `K` connection to reduce brightness and match the red level.

### ðŸŸ¢ðŸ”´ RA4 with RA5 (2-pin bicolor only)  
> [!NOTE]
> A single 100â€“120â€¯Î© resistor is sufficient and should be placed in series with either side of the bicolor LED.  
> Only one resistor is needed (on RA4 or RA5). Adding a second is optional and typically only used for brightness balancing.

Use RA4 **only** in conjunction with RA5 when using a 2-pin bicolor LED:
- RA4 = 0, RA5 = 1 â†’ Green (idle)
- RA4 = 1, RA5 = 0 â†’ Red (combo/reset)
- During reset blink: RA5 toggles, RA4 remains OFF (no green blink)  

> [!WARNING] 
> RA4 should **not** be used for single LEDs. It does not indicate reset blink and provides incorrect behavior alone.
